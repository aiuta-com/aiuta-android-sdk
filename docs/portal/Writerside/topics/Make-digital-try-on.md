# Make digital try on

In this tutorial, you will learn how to make your first generation with [Aiuta Digital Try On](https://developer.aiuta.com/products/digital-try-on) 


## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial:
- [Initialize Fashion Try On](Getting-started-with-Fashion-Try-On.md)


## SKU Catalog items

To implement generation with [Aiuta Digital Try](https://developer.aiuta.com/products/digital-try-on) you
should have `skuId` of the item, Ð¸y which we can determine which fitting needs to be done for the photo.

Perhaps you already have a set of SKY with all the necessary meta information, then
move on to the [next section](Make-digital-try-on.md#start-generation). Otherwise, you have the option to get a list of SKUs 
from the `getSKUItems()` method by passing the `categoryName`. Default category name is **aiuta_demo**

> `getSKUItems()` is a paging method, therefore it has addition `paginationOffset` and
> `paginationLimit` input parameters, with a help of which backend can determinate new page.
> 
> You can use your own implementation of pagination or pay attention on [default realisation](Paging.md)
> with a help of [Paging 3 library](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/paging/v3-overview).

## Start generation

For starting generation your need 3 things:
- `skuId` - which will use to fit on uploaded photo
- `fileUri` - uri of the photo, on which we will fit SKU
- `skuCatalogName` (optional) - category name of the generated SKU

After receiving all the necessary information, feel free to call the `startSKUGeneration()` method,
passing all the data through a special wrapper `SKUGenerationContainer`:
```kotlin
val fashionTryOn: FashionTryOn = ...

//...

fashionTryOn.startSKUGeneration(
    container = SKUGenerationContainer(
        fileUri = ...,
        skuId = ...,
        skuCatalogName = ...,
    ),
)
```

> Be careful with possible throwing exceptions, which you can find 
> in [code documentation](https://github.com/aiuta-com/android-sdk/blob/4df9d1fa9b8800b81938196f39661c202c399aa3/fashion-tryon-core/src/main/kotlin/com/aiuta/fashionsdk/tryon/core/FashionTryOn.kt#L62) 
{style="warning"}


## Observing result

After the generation starts, you need to wait for some time until the entire result is ready.
You can track the current status and get the result through `FashionTryOn.skuGenerationStatus`.
As the result is ready, the necessary `SKUGenerationStatus` will be emitted.

To learn more about all possible `SKUGenerationStatus`, see [code](https://github.com/aiuta-com/android-sdk/blob/main/fashion-tryon-core/src/main/kotlin/com/aiuta/fashionsdk/tryon/core/domain/models/SKUGenerationStatus.kt)
or [api reference](https://aiuta-com.github.io/android-sdk-docs-api/fashion-tryon-core/com.aiuta.fashionsdk.tryon.core.domain.models/-s-k-u-generation-status/index.html)
