 * Platform-agnostic interface for drawable resources in the Aiuta SDK.

 * This interface provides a unified way to handle drawable resources across
 * different platforms (Android, iOS, Desktop) within the Aiuta SDK. Each
 * platform can provide its own implementation while maintaining a consistent API.
 *
 * Platform implementations:
 * - Android: [AiutaAndroidDrawable], [AiutaAndroidDrawableRes]
 * - Compose Multiplatform: [AiutaComposeDrawableResource]
 * - iOS/Native: [AiutaIOSSkia]
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * // Using with Compose Multiplatform resources
 * val icon = AiutaComposeDrawableResource(Res.drawable.my_icon)
 *
 * // Using with Android drawable resource
 * val androidIcon = AiutaAndroidDrawableRes(R.drawable.my_icon)
 * ```
 *
 * @property resource Platform-specific drawable resource object
