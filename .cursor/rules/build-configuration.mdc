# Build Configuration Guide

## Gradle Setup

The project uses Gradle with Kotlin DSL for build configuration. Key files:

- [build.gradle.kts](mdc:build.gradle.kts) - Main build configuration
- [settings.gradle.kts](mdc:settings.gradle.kts) - Project settings and module inclusion
- [gradle.properties](mdc:gradle.properties) - Gradle and Android properties

## Build Commands

Common build commands:
```bash
./gradlew build        # Build all modules
./gradlew clean        # Clean build artifacts
./gradlew test         # Run tests
./gradlew assemble     # Create release artifacts
```

## Version Management

1. Version numbers are managed in [gradle.properties](mdc:gradle.properties)
2. Dependencies are managed in [build.gradle.kts](mdc:build.gradle.kts)
3. Use semantic versioning for releases
4. Update version numbers in all relevant files

## Build Configuration Guidelines

1. Keep dependencies up to date
2. Use version catalogs for dependency management
3. Follow Android best practices for build configuration
4. Maintain consistent versioning across modules
5. Document any special build requirements
6. Use appropriate build types and flavors
7. Configure ProGuard rules when needed
8. Set up proper signing configuration for releases
