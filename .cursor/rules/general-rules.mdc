# General Coding and Documentation Guidelines

## Code Quality

1. Use explicit variable names over short, ambiguous ones
2. Follow consistent coding style throughout the project
3. Prioritize performance in all implementations
4. Implement robust error handling and logging
5. Follow modular design principles
6. Ensure version compatibility
7. Replace hardcoded values with named constants
8. Consider and handle edge cases
9. Include assertions for validation

## Documentation Standards

1. Verify information before presenting
2. Make changes file by file
3. Preserve existing code and structures
4. Provide real file links
5. Include appropriate test coverage
6. Consider security implications
7. Document error handling
8. Include version information
9. Document edge cases

## Development Process

1. Make single chunk edits
2. Avoid unnecessary updates
3. Don't remove unrelated code
4. Don't make assumptions without evidence
5. Don't suggest whitespace changes
6. Don't summarize changes
7. Don't invent changes beyond requests
8. Don't ask for unnecessary confirmations
9. Don't show current implementation unless requested
